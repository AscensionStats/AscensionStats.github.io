Elemental stats, reduction and parry come from a table construced by testing.

Flat Dam is a linear scaling between 50 at level 75, and 850 at level 325.

Base HP is Level^1.645. Each mob has a fixed contant k, with the actual HP of the mob equal to k x BaseHP - 500.

Mob Spells were scraped off of the beastiary. Where mutliple spells have the same name, there are likekly to be errors. All spells are the level 6 versions, which may not be what is used by the Ascension (or normal) mob.
